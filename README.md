Fox Box Insurance (FBI) is a collection of tools and services built to make Discord safer, more transparent, and secure. Instead of focusing on traditional moderation commands, FBI prioritizes data ownership, full transparency, and user empowerment. FBI is forever built for you - the user - and you control everything about the bot.

## Repositories

## Why FBI?
Discord bots usually revolve around commands like `ban`, `kick`, and `warn`. All of these bots focus on *preventing* chaos but never really prepare for it. FBI is built to do the opposite - recover after chaos and put power back into your hands where it belongs. Full server backups, channel exports, and way more coming *very* soon. FBI is built primarily for admins and developers who want deeper insight and tighter control.
